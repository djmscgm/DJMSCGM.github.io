      <h2>About Us</h2>
	  <img src="tch_blue.jpeg" alt=""/>
	  <p><strong>Tri-City Hustlerz (TCH) Urban Soul Line Dance Group</strong> 
		 is based out of Greensboro, NC and known throughout 
		 the urban/soul line dance community. Affectionately 
		 known as TCH, the group was founded in 2011 and is 
		 led by the Award-winning <em>Instructor Extraordinaire, 
		 Mr. Stefhon Cave</em>, who instructs <strong>ALL</strong> 
		 <q>levels</q> of line dance.</p>
	  <p>Initially adopting <q>Showtime</q> as his line dance name,   
		 some of his close friends that Stefhon danced with 
		 encouraged him to use the name <q>Major Swagg</q> because 
		 he exuded confidence in a major way. He decided to   
		 name the ladies of his group <q>Swagg Angelz</q> because 
		 they were his <q>girls</q> after a friend's group were  
		 known as <q>Swag Dolls</q>.</p>
	  <p>Swagg is added to end of each name to identify them 
		 as a member or having affiliation with <strong>TCH</strong>.</p>
