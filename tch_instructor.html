	 <p>Stefhon Cave is the instructor for TCH. His love for dancing
		started long before line dancing. He was born a dancer and
		will always be a dancer.</p>
	 <p>Stefhon started line dancing in 2011 in Greensboro at Peeler
		Recreation Center in Mr. Warren Gamble's <q>Jus Havin Fun</q>
		class on Wednesday nights. He began learning line dances and
		immediately developed a love for it. The ore he learned, the
		more he wanted to know. He then wanted his own class. Once 
		Mr. Warren retired, Stefhon took over his class. Because of
		his love for wanting to know and learn more, he was called
		<q>Spongebob</q>. Major Swagg had a smoothness to his style
		of dance. He also began a class on Tuesday evenings at Brown
		Recreation Center, which became the class that <q>Tri-City
		Hustlerz</q> TCH was created. With his love of dances, He
		continued learning and begin to create dances. He began 
		attending line dance events to dance with fellow line dancers
		in the community. He is a UC nominated award-winning great
		instructor. Once TCH commenced hosting events, he created
		the <q>Swaggie Award</q> to recognize those in the line dance
		community. The events would take place in either the summer <q>
		Summer Swagg</q> or the winter, <q>Holiday Swagg</q>. The first
		event hosted by TCH was Holiday Swagg in December 2012.</p>
	 <p>During the Pandemic, Major Swagg taught classes outside in person,
		as well as virtually to help keep everyone moving and current on
		dances.</p>
	 <p>He now has three classes weekly, in person as well as virtual.</p>
	 <p>You can find him on the dance floor!</p>
